# Introduction
This is a sample to demonstrate how to custom bootstrap Angular after some server side data has been asynchronously loaded. The data is then used to configure a provider which provides different service implementations.

# Run the Application
Clone this repository. In a terminal navigate to the folder and use e.g. http-server to run the Application

```
npm install http-server -g
http-server -p 3000
```

Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`
